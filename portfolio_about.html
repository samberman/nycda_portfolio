      <p>I don't really mind if it's over your head. My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info. Ah, it's like that man, it's like that (yes!). A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever. Don't let the storm of life scare ya. Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts. (suddenly drifting by just...). Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closin the shop. Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it. So raise up squire, address your attire. Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation. (I got lyrics to go) It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all. Lifeless ventures ain't new boo. I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing. Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin</p>
